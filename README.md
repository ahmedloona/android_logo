Followed a walk-through tutorial for building this animated Android as part of The Odin Project Curriculum

Build the Android logo using just HTML and CSS by watching this video from an amazing website called The Code Player. Itâ€™s like a tutorial but it actually plays the code as the original developer created it. Use your own text editor (which you can view by opening the .html file in your browser)
